  // Potential errors:
  // Repeat names
// Each sheet named "STRAINNAME_log2_expression"
  // Wrong sheet naming format
// Left column: id. 3 letters and a number generally (?)
  // Incorrect name/wrong naming format
// All other column headers are whole numbers. (Timepoints) (Only 15, 30, and/or 60)
  // Non 15 or 30 or 60 number
  // Not a number
// Same timepoints for all strains...But # replications may vary.
  // Different timepoints (one only has 15, another only has 30)
  // Make sure it accepts different # replications
