                    GRNsight is an open source web application for visualizing models of small- to medium-scale gene regulatory networks. GRNsight is a joint project of the <a href="http://www.lmu.edu/" target="_blank">Loyola Marymount University</a> Bioinformatics and Biomathematics Groups, headed by <a href="http://myweb.lmu.edu/kdahlqui/index.htm" target="_blank">Dr. Kam Dahlquist</a>, <a href="http://myweb.lmu.edu/dondi/" target="_blank">Dr. John David N. Dionisio</a>, and <a href="http://myweb.lmu.edu/bfitzpatrick/" target="_blank">Dr. Ben G. Fitzpatrick</a>.  Undergraduate students initiated the development of GRNsight in Spring 2014, including Britain Southwick (Computer Science, ’14) and Nicole Anguiano (Computer Science, ’16), with consultation from Katrina Sherbina (Biomathematics, ’14).  For a list of other former and current developers, see the <a href="http://dondi.github.io/GRNsight/people.html">People page</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_regulatory_network" target="_blank">gene regulatory network (GRN)</a> consists of genes, transcription factors, and the regulatory connections between them, which govern the level of expression of mRNA and protein from those genes. GRNs can be mathematically modeled and simulated by applications such as <a href = "http://kdahlquist.github.io/GRNmap/index.html" target = "blank">GRNmap</a>, a MATLAB program that estimates the parameters and performs forward simulations of a differential equations model of a GRN. Computer representations of GRNs, such as the models output by GRNmap, are in the form of a tabular spreadsheet (adjacency matrix) that is not easily interpretable. Ideally, GRNs should be displayed as diagrams (graphs) detailing the regulatory relationships (edges) between each gene (node) in the network. To address this need, we developed GRNsight.
                    <br><br>
                    GRNsight allows users to upload spreadsheets generated by GRNmap and uses the information in these spreadsheets to automatically create and display a graph of the GRN model through a physics-based force simulation or in a grid layout. The application colors the edges and adjusts their thickness based on the sign (activation or repression) and the strength (magnitude) of the regulatory relationship, respectively. Nodes can be colored based on time course gene expression data found in the GRNmap spreadsheet. Finally, GRNsight allows the user to modify the graph in order to define the best visual layout for the network. Most of GRNsight is written in JavaScript. HTTP requests are handled using <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and the <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express framework</a>. Graphs are generated through <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a>, a JavaScript data visualization library.
                    <br><br>
                    Although originally designed for gene regulatory networks, we believe that GRNsight has general applicability for displaying any small, unweighted or weighted network with directed edges for systems biology or other application domains.

When "Format edges based on optimized weight parameters" is selected, spreadsheets named "network_optimized_weights" containing weighted values in the adjacency matrix will display with color and variable thicknesses depending on the weight values of the relationships between edges. If "Default to black edges with regular arrowheads" is selected, all graphs will appear as unweighted graphs.

Mac users can utilize native print to PDF function available from their operating system to print the graph to a PDF file. Windows users will need to have the full version of Adobe Acrobat (or other "print to PDF" utility) to print graphs to a PDF file. There is a known bug with the print function printing an extra blank page that is currently being investigated for a fix in a later release.

                                                    <li>Code was brached so that the stable v1.2 runs on the GRNsight home page, while v1.3 Beta runs on a new Beta page for live testing of new features.</li>
                                                    <li> Improvements were made to the user interface layout:
                                                        <ul>
                                                            <li>A menu bar was implemented to organize GRNsight functions and options.</li>
                                                            <li>Instead of separate “Open” and “Submit” buttons, the “Open” menu option opens a dialog from which to choose a GRNmap spreadsheet and then automatically loads the graph; a new "Reload" option was implemented that reloads the current graph.</li>
                                                            <li>Information about each force graph parameter was added into a tooltip that appears upon hovering over the label.</li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>A Demo menu option was implemented to load sample unweighted and weighted gene regulatory networks.</li>
                                                    <li>For graphs with weighted edges, the method for determining the thickness and coloring of the edges was changed. The way that GRNsight now determines the edge thickness is as follows. GRNsight divides all weight values by the absolute value of the maximum weight in the matrix to normalize all the values to between zero and 1. GRNsight then adjusts the thickness of the lines to vary continuously from the minimum thickness (for normalized weights near zero) to maximum thickness (normalized weights of 1). Edges with positive normalized weight values from 0.05 to 1 are colored magenta; edges with negative normalized weight values from -0.05 to -1 are colored cyan. Edges with normalized weight values between -0.05 and 0.05 are colored grey.</li>
                                                    <li>Improvements were made to the appearance of the triangular arrowheads, blunt arrowheads, and circular edges. The triangular arrowheads and blunt arrowheads were also changed to be assigned on the same continuous linear scale as the edges.</li>
                                                    <li>Cosmetic issues and performance issues were fixed by temporarily removing the highlighting and outlining of edges.</li>
                                                    <li>The ranges and default values of the force graph parameters were adjusted to optimize the automatic layout of the Demo networks consisting of 21 nodes and 50 edges.</li>
                                                    <li>grnsight.cs.lmu.edu was configured to serve 4 services via standard ports to reduce likelihood of blockage by anti-malware software.</li>
